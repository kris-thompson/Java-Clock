Ok so first of all, all of the buttons and the clock of my program actually work!
first time in a while ive pulled that off.
Now for my code brief comments inside the code quickly explain what each segment of the code does.
The app on a whole was supposed to be an alarm clock app that made noise when the current time and set time matched, 
also i was going to try to add images to pop up aswell when the alarm was triggered.
Now the alarm sound, image popup, and clock themselves work properly.
But due to time constraints i was not able to combine all the parts for a correct alarm trigger.
My last button was an attempt at setting equal times for the alarm to sound, but i could only do the opposite
which is the alarm sounding when the times are different.
All in all though the app works , i have a dyanamic clock which was tough to figure out, and the parts seperatly all function.
